/* Java Vs C++

* - Simple: because it removes complex topics from c++, we don't have concept of pointers

* - Portability: when a program yields a same result on every machine we call it a portable language. it portable because of 'system independence'

* nature of java;

* - System Independence: Java is based on bytecode system, that is platform independence.

* - Multithreaded

*

*

* Memory Allocation: (run time data areas)

* - Method Area :Stores the class code, code of the variables, code of the methods.

* - Heap : The area where objects are created.

* - Java Stack :

* - PC (Program Counter)

* - Native Methods

*

* Program Execution:

* 1. first .java program is converted to .class file, class file containes the byte code instructions

* (Java Compiler is outside the JVM ) (JRE, JDK, JIT- It increases speed of the program)

* 2. .class is given to JVM and it has a module "class loader subsystem" which performs the following operations

* - it loads the .class file into the memory

* - then it verfies the byte code instructions, if anything suspicious found it will reject the program execution

* - if verified successfully it will allocate the memory as discussed above.
